This Video and Audio Web Minor Project demonstrates the ability to integrate multimedia elements into a web page using basic web technologiesâ€”HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project provides users with a seamless experience for playing, pausing, and controlling video and audio elements directly from the browser.

By combining HTML5's native <video> and <audio> tags, custom JavaScript functionality, and stylish CSS, the project offers a user-friendly interface for media playback. It showcases essential skills in web development, including interactive media control, responsive design, and simple JavaScript event handling.

This project serves as a foundational step for anyone looking to enhance their skills in web development, specifically in handling multimedia content and creating interactive user interfaces.

Further improvements can be made to enhance accessibility features, such as adding captions and improving the design for mobile responsiveness.
